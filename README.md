# RadonEyeToExcel
RadonEye log files are a bit hard to understand in context because the readings are associated with an incrementing count rather than an actual timestamp. 

This script solves the problem by converting RadonEye logs into a simple Excel file with two columns: Date/Time and Radon Level.

Please note that your Radon Eye log file should be unaltered (ex. don't rename it) as the script depends on the default file name to calculate the time span.
